            <p>
                I'm Konstantin Nochevny, a tech enthusiast and full-stack developer with a solid background in digital
                marketing and web development. My journey began post-military service, where I quickly excelled in SEO,
                PPC,
                and web design, leading to the co-founding of a digital services firm.

            <p>
                After three years of developing strategic digital solutions, I pursued advanced technical training at
                Coding
                Academy, graduating from an intensive full-stack development program. Today, I am proficient in both the
                MERN and MEVN stacks, equipped to tackle complex technological challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dedicated to innovation, my goal is to enhance backend functionalities and user experiences, driving
                success
                in every project I undertake.
